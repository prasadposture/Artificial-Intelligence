# Artificial-Intelligence
This repository contains all the assignments and projects I will be submitting during one month of the "Artificial Intelligence Course" offered by MyCaptain.
It may seem that all of the notebooks are marked as `Artificial Intelligence Course Project` but these all aren't course projects some of them are just beginner friendly assignments to get started with the course.
